# Deluge LED Font

### A True Type font of the Deluge special-character alphabet.

The Synthstrom Deluge has a 4-digit LED display. It uses a special alphanumeric character set that can be displayed on the 7-segment display.

This True Type font allows you to use those special characters in Deluge cheatsheets, tutorials, overlays, manuals, videos, etc.

The uppercase and lowercase characters are the same. The punctuation set is limited to comma, period, exclamation mark, hash, carat, dash and underscore.

**Note:** the comma and the period both display the dot after the digit. The hash displays the dot after the *previous* digit.
